Terraform Infrastructure as Code Lab Guide
=========================================

Welcome
-------

Welcome to the Terraform Infrastructure as Code Lab!

In this lab we will be deploying a multi-tiered web application to the cloud.  To accomplish this we'll first need need to define the infrastructure supporting our application as well as how we're going to secure it.  Rather than doing this manually within the cloud provider portal, we're going to define our infrastructure in code using Terraform's declarative language.

plans in Terraform, manage them in a version control system, and deploy the infrastructure using integrated build tools.  A key element of this infrastructure design is the Palo Alto Networks VM-Series firewall.  

Prior to deployment, we will define the VM-series firewall configuration using the Terraform provider for PAN-OS.  These configurations will be applied to Panorama rather than the VM-series firewall itself.  Once it is bootstrapped, the firewall will register to Panorama and learn it's initial configuration.  

Lastly, we will ensure that the firewall is able to respond effectively to changes made to the application infrastructure.  


Objective
---------
The objective of this workshop is to deploy and secure a `WordPress <https://wordpress.org>`_ content management system in Google Cloud Platform.  This web application will be supported by an `Apache <https://httpd.apache.org>`_ web server and a `MariaDB <https://mariadb.org/>`_ database server residing in two separate subnets.  

As part of our infrastructure deployment, a VM-Series virtual firewall will be inserted between the untrusted public subnet, the web subnet, and the database subnet.  Our goal is to define, deploy, and configure all cloud infrastructure elements including the VM-series firewall using Terraform exclusively.


Learning Outcomes
----------
- Understand the various methods for automating the deployment of Palo Alto Networks NGFW instances in cloud environments
- Learn to use industry-leading configuration management automation tools to implement changes to PAN-OS devices
- Learn how the Palo Alto Networks NGFW can automatically respond to changes in the network environment
